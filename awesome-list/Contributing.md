# Contributing to Awesome AI Agents 2026

First off, thank you. This list only stays useful because people like you take the time to keep it accurate and current.

There are four ways to contribute:

- **Add a new tool** - something missing that belongs here
- **Update an existing entry** - description is wrong or links are broken
- **Remove a dead project** - unmaintained repos that no longer belong
- **Improve the structure** - better categories, clearer descriptions, fixed typos

All contributions go through a pull request. It takes about 5 minutes.

## Entry Format

Every entry follows this exact format:

```markdown
- [Tool Name](https://github.com/org/repo) - One sentence describing what the tool does and what makes it distinct.
```

**Rules:**

- Entry starts with `- ` (a markdown list item)
- Tool name is a link in square brackets: `[Tool Name](url)`
- Description follows ` - ` (space, hyphen, space) after the closing parenthesis
- Description is exactly **one sentence**, ending with a period
- No promotional language ("the best", "revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Entries within each category are sorted **alphabetically** by tool name

**Good example:**

```markdown
- [Mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) - Memory layer for AI applications with long-term, short-term, and semantic memory extraction.
```

**Bad examples:**

```markdown
# Wrong: uses heading instead of list item
### Mem0
**[GitHub](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0)** - Memory layer for AI

# Wrong: uses em-dash instead of hyphen
- [Mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) — Memory layer for AI applications.

# Wrong: multiple sentences
- [Mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) - Memory layer for AI applications. It supports long-term memory extraction.
```

## Inclusion Criteria

Your tool should meet **all** of the following:

1. **Directly related to AI agents** - not a general LLM tool, not a prompt library, not a generic API wrapper
2. **Actively maintained** - last commit within the past 6 months
3. **Publicly available** - open-source with a GitHub/GitLab repo, or a live hosted product with a public URL
4. **Not a duplicate** - check the list first to make sure it is not already included
5. **Functional** - the tool must actually work, not just be a README with no code

Wait, tools that are **experimental, early-stage, or have few stars** are welcome as long as they meet all five criteria above. We value breadth of coverage.
